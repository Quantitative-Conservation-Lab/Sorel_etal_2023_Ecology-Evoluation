# Wenatchee-screw-traps

The goal of this repository is to estimate the number and timing of juvenile Chinook migrating out of natal streams in the Wenatchee Basin.

Please do not distributre any of the data in this repository without permission. 

The controlling script for the analysis is `SR_all_LVR.R`, which sources a number of other `R` and `.cpp` scripts within the `src` folder. 

Please let me know if anything is confusing or requires additional documention.

Thanks!
