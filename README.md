# Wenatchee-screw-traps

The goal of this repository is to modeling the abundance juvenile Chinook salmon emigrating from natal streams at different ages in the Wenatchee Basin.

The controlling script for the analysis is `SR_all_LVR.R`, which sources a number of other `R` and `.cpp` scripts within the `src` folder. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks!
